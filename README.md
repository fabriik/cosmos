### bitcoin done right

This is the Android port of the breadwallet iOS app, which can be found [here](https://github.com/breadwallet/breadwallet/).

### a completely standalone bitcoin wallet

Unlike many other bitcoin wallets, breadwallet is a real standalone bitcoin client. There is no server to get hacked or go down, so you can always access your money. Using [SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients) mode, breadwallet connects directly to the bitcoin network with the fast performance you need on a mobile device.

### the next step in wallet security

breadwallet is designed to protect you from malware, browser security holes, *even physical theft*. With AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing, and verified boot, breadwallet represents a significant security advance over web and desktop wallets.

### beautiful simplicity

Simplicity is breadwallet's core design principle. A simple backup phrase is all you need to restore your wallet on another device if yours is ever lost or broken.  Because breadwallet is  [deterministic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki), your balance and transaction history can be recovered from just your backup phrase.

## Advanced setup

### Blockset Client Token

The [Blockset client token](https://blockset.com/docs/v1/tools/authentication) can be set in [gradle.properties](gradle.properties) or by using `-PBDB_CLIENT_TOKEN="<client token>"`.
A default token is available for testing.

### Firebase

To enable Firebase services like Crashlytics, add the `google-services.json` file into the `app` directory.
Without this file, runtime Firebase dependencies are still used but do not start and the Google Services gradle plugin is disabled so builds will succeed.
